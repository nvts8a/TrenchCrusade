1,Heretic Legion,"A shroud of darkness blankets the world. Smoke and brimstone spews from the yawning gates of Inferno, enveloping the lands where people have abandoned God and openly wage war against His Creation. It is a grim reality that a full third of humanity has bent its knee before the idols of Hell. The main military force of Satan on Earth is the Heretic Legions, raised from amongst these citizens of the damned. Under special absolution from the Cardinal Protector, many spies have been dispatched into Hell's domains over the years. Most are never seen again, though the eternally screaming heads of some have been returned to New Antioch, branded with bleeding runes that mock the Holy Trinity. | Yet some do make it back to the light, whispering of the horrors they have witnessed: of firstborn cast into the mouths of the burning statues of Baal and human flesh sold by the pound in dreadful markets. They speak of the great idols of the Golden Calf and rapturous men and women who prostrate themselves before them, carving layers of their own flesh in ecstatic offering. Inverted pyramids and towers plunge into the depths of these cities, built of iron and black stone. Within these pits stand sacrificial altars where weeping captives are slowly sliced to death over agonising days and weeks with wicked knives made of infernal basalt. Cathedrals to the Princes of Hell hang from great arches of volcanic stone, while condemned are crucified on hundreds of upside-down crosses. | Accounts speak of sprawling factories made of mutilated flesh and metal, their forges yielding endless munitions for the ongoing war. Guided by the teachings of Tartarus' smiths, alchemists toil over colossal weapons and armoured behemoths, wielding the forbidden secrets of their patrons' metallurgy to forge instruments of death and suffering beyond the grasp of any human engineer. These are once-proud cities of Earth, where churches have been toppled and entire populations are now dedicated towards bringing down the very Throne of Heaven. | Amongst the forsaken citizens that endure within the earthly domains of Hell, the greatest status is afforded to the soldiers fighting in the Great War. But joining the army of damnation is no easy task. Those who wish to win a place amongst the Heretic Legions must make an unholy pilgrimage to the burning bronze gates of Hell. Even from leagues away, the infernal heat emanating from this great edifice sears both flesh and spirit until the pain becomes unbearable. In the Valley of Tears the great road that leads to the gate, paved as it is with wailing souls and lamentations, is littered with endless mounds of charred bodies. Many are still half-alive, writhing in agony, trapped in a grotesque twilight between life and death, their wickedness deemed insufficient. These discarded souls are doomed to writhe in agony until the Day of Judgement. | Those who make it within sight of Hell's Maw are considered worthy and are initiated into the Legions, taking unbreakable vows that chain them into darkness for all eternity, their bodies branded with the mark of the Devil Lord that has claimed them. Armouries of Hell then equip them for battle and Heretic Priests beckon forth new supplicants as dictated by the whispers of their patron arch-devils. Thus a new Heretic Legionnaire is born. They hail Archdevils as their masters and are thus damned for all eternity. | Yet there are some who push further on: to the very Gate itself and beyond. Their very flesh ignites, never to recover, but those with the blackest souls can enter Inferno itself. Amongst those the Anointed are especially revered amongst the Legions. They are the paragons of unhinged brutality - men and women of colossal vigour and unyielding devotion. Having tread the accursed path to the shores of the Lake of Eternal Flame, where the damned wither and contort in ceaseless torment, the Anointed emerge forever scarred by the embrace of abyssal fires. The blackened and burnt flesh of the Anointed will never heal, but in exchange they are granted the right to wear Heavy Gehenna armoured suits and they gain strength to wield weapons that a normal man could barely lift. It is said that glancing into their eyes one can see the reflection of the very flames of Hell, forever etched in their vision. | Yet some who witness go even further in their depraved devotion. Suicide is a mortal sin and one eagerly embraced by many. Most cry out for devils to notice their final sacrifice in vain, as the Infernal nobles are capricious and delight in betraying their own as much as their enemies. But those with truly wicked and depraved souls are resurrected in contempt of the Redeemer, coming back as Choristers, horrific mockeries of Creation whose severed heads sing unholy hymns praising the Devil, their voices causing the ears of their enemies to bleed. | Though the vast bulk of the Heretic Legions are made of mortal humans, Hell often sends their own abhorrent progeny to reinforce their mortal foot soldiers: nightmarish War Beasts made of captured and possessed creatures and dreaded Artillery Witches who act as mobile artillery supporting lighting assaults. Thus, in this accursed theatre of war, mortals and abominations march hand in withering hand, bound by the suffering ties of damnation. The wails of tortured beasts meld with the shrieks of damned souls, while the skies rain down fiery retribution upon all who dare to oppose the Heretics' ceaseless crusade for a demented parity with their Creator."
2,Trench Pilgrims,"As the war rages against the minions of Hell, strange visions torment the faithful across the globe. Men and women touched by Heaven are granted visions and Revelations are made by the messengers of God. Sisters of the Holy Orders are marked by Stigmata and take up the sword and the cross as instructed by angels. Those who have transgressed seek to atone for their sins by taking as many followers of the Devil with them to the afterlife.| So they come, the mad and the maimed, the God- touched and the guilt-ridden - all gathering around Prophets and Prophetesses, forming Trench Pilgrim Processions. These disorganised groups arm themselves and follow the prophets of the Lord unto the front lines. They fight with unrivalled zeal, hurling themselves against the Heretics, arming themselves with anything they can get their hands on from the oldest muskets to scourges and Molotov Cocktails.| Pilgrims are not officially sanctioned by the Holy See of New Antioch, but the Church still blesses the crusades of the faithful. Thus the Pilgrim Processions are a common sight on the battlefields, often crossing No Man's Land in suicidal assaults upon the Heretics, directed by the visions of their Prophets and Prophetesses who lead them, urged on by the whips of Castigators who are charged with instilling the Fear of God in their troops.| The bulk of the Pilgrims are men and women with little military training, but when they don the Iron Capirote of a Trench Pilgrim, they can face even a demon from the deepest Bolgias of Hell unflinchingly. Nor is death necessarily an end to their mission: sometimes the Seventh Meta-Christ will deem a fallen pilgrim worthy and bring them back as Martyr- Penitents: warriors half-way between Heaven and Earth, able to fight once more and feel no pain from bullet or bayonet thrust.| Rarer and more dangerous are the Stigmatic Nuns, Holy Sisters who manifest wounds to match those of the Third Meta-Christ whom they venerate. They excel in close quarter combat, for each bleeding wound that they suffer makes them stronger, not weaker, as their devotion to suffering as their Lord once did gives them strength and endurance not found in common mortals. Armed with swords and pistols, they cross No Man's Land heedless of any danger, praying to sustain wounds for the Redeemer which in turn will transform them into the very Vengeance of the Lord.| In front of the Trench Pilgrims are driven the Ecclesiastic Prisoners - either captured enemies of the True Faith or volunteer sinners. Each is strapped with a high explosive which is detonated once they reach enemy lines. They dash across the killing grounds, hoping to somehow survive the blast and escape, or take as many followers of Lucifer with them as they can, depending on their convictions.| The most puissant of Pilgrim Processions will be accompanied by a Shrine Anchorite, a metal behemoth some twelve feet tall, a living altar of war almost completely immune to any damage. The interior of the Anchorite is covered in spikes and barbed hooks so that the monk pilot is in a constant state of torment, rejoicing in their pain so they can suffer as their Lord once did. In combat they wield Adamantine Catherine Wheels of massive proportions which they use to crush sinners and heretics into a pulp, stringing them upon the wheel as a warning to others.| There are a bewildering number and variety of Trench Pilgrim Processions: The Path of Pious Revenge swears in the name of St. Olga and uses flamethrowers, burning grenades and incendiary ammunition to assail the Heretics. The Pilgrims of the Iron Path follow St. Rita of Cascia and go to battle with hammers, mauls, maces and cudgels, and hammer nails into their heads in the memory of the saint they venerate. The Theban Legion of Rome carries the heads of the heretics upon their standards in the memory of their patron, St. Marice. They fight with swords and other blades, competing with each other for the number of heretic heads they amass.| Trench Pilgrims of the Procession of the Sacred Affliction are known for their zeal in close quarter combat, their armour decorated with icons and shields adorned with the depictions of the Saints, which despite appearances can withstand machine gun bullets. The millstones they carry upon their backs are used to tie about the necks of sinners before drowning them in the mud and blood of No Man's Land."
3,The Iron Sultanate,"When the Infidels opened the thrice- cursed Gate to Jahannam, releasing Gog and Magog upon those who believe, it seemed that all was lost and Shaytan would emerge victorious over Dunya. But the Creator of the Universe came to the aid of the Faithful, and as had been written, the great Iron Wall of Dhu al-Qarnayn manifested itself in the lands ruled by the Sultan of Rûm. A call was sent to those who believe righteously and, over the coming decades, the migration of the Faithful took place across Europa, Asia and Africa. Millions perished on the road and at sea, for the Heretics and their Shaytan lords swarmed them as locusts swarm fields of ripe sesame, devouring them and building vile monuments from their limbs and heads, so they could not be buried as is decreed in the Holy texts. But once all those who survived the journey had come, the mighty Gates of al-Qarnayn were closed and the Great Sultanate of the Invincible Iron Wall of the Two Horns That Pierce the Sky was formed.| The assaults of the slaves of Jahannam against the Sultanate have never ceased since that day, and each day new martyrs are mourned as they defend the Wall and confront the heretics who have overcome its defences. But within the walls, the lost knowledge flourishes and from mosques of white marble and gold the muezzin call the faithful to pray for the success of the Sultan's army as it struggles to protect their lands and defend the caravan trails that provide the Sultanate with vital trade goods.| The Iron Wall is the greatest defensive work in the world, a mighty bulwark festooned with the famed artillery of the Sultan. Azeb sharpshooters stand at ready, ever watchful for surprise attacks, and the elite Janissary regiments have barracks at set intervals near the wall so they can react to any attack at speed. During a more serious incursion a full muster of Azebs is called, the House of Wisdom unleashes its terrifying takwin creations upon the foe, and if the need is desperate, the Sultan himself comes forth and his Janissaries march with him to do battle, carrying their green flag before them.| Thus the protection of the Iron Wall has had an extensive influence on the Sultanate Way of war. The conscripted Azebs are experts at feigned flight and skirmish, while the loping Lions of Jabir harass the enemy's flanks. All the while the superb artillery of the Sultan bombards the enemy as they make their tortuous journey across the battlefield littered with traps set by skilled Sappers. When they reach the ranks of the faithful, the Janissaries, Sultan's elite household troops, close in and finish the enemy with their devastating counter-charge led by their iron- willed officers. Dreaded Assassins from Alamut prowl in the winds of time, striking the enemy elites and leaders, while the Alchemists of the House of Wisdom unleash devastating weapons made deadly by their elemental mastery, capable of overcoming the defences of virtually any foe.| Beyond the Iron Wall forces of the Sultan operate in small, mobile companies, each with a particular mission to accomplish. They hunt down apostates that have gone to serve Shaytans, look for the relics from the time of the Prophets, or seek to recover lost treasures and books of knowledge from the ruins of the fallen Caliphates. Though an understanding between the Church and the Sultanate on being co- belligerents against Jahannam exists, the commanders of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and do not hesitate to crush those who would hinder their mission. Resentment against the infidels who unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate, and matters of honour are swiftly resolved with duels to the death. Woe to those who dare to hinder the mission of Those Who Believe."
4,The Principality of New Antioch,"For three hundred years the Principality of New Antioch has stood defiantly as the focal point of the Church and the Faithful at the very edge of the shadow cast by the Gate of Hell. It is the Home of All Our Hopes, the bulwark against Heretic forces and the first line of defence against the devil's might. Should New Antioch fall, the Levant will be lost and the path to heartlands of the Church will be wide open.| War has never left this corner of the world. The ancient city of Antioch was destroyed by a mysterious demonic weapon in the year 1545, but the Faithful never gave up their positions in the ruins. Despite the lethal demonic essence emanating from the crater that was left behind, the garrison held on, even as mighty Constantinople fell to the legions of Kimaris, Marquis of Hell.| Before it was destroyed, the ancient city of Antioch was always the first line of defence to be put to test. Thus it is no wonder that in the year 1559 the Sword Congress of Vienna agreed to rebuild and fortify the city, and that a yearly tithe is to be sent to New Antioch by all the Faithful nations, though this levy is rarely in form of coin. Instead, endless supply trains of foodstuffs, tools, ammunition, weaponry, machinery and skilled workers and engineers come from across Europa and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the African dominions.| Since those days New Antioch has grown to be the most important fortress-city in the world, the Sword and the Shield of Europa and Africa. All the princes of the Church and heads of the various states and domains who oppose Hell understand that it is better to fight their battles against the Heretics as far away from their heartlands as possible. To this day New Antioch has withstood eight great sieges and its famed walls, with their seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been breached. This is partly due to hundreds of anchorites, metallic battle shrines with devotees entombed within them, that are embedded into the walls, keeping a vigilant watch over the walls day and night.| More than anything else, it is the volunteers who come to serve under the Banner of Christ that ensure the continuous existence of the Principality. Thus in the streets of the city one can hear hundreds of languages and dialects. One might observe hussars of the Polish- Lithuanian commonwealth brushing shoulders with the last remnants of the Varangian Guard, or hear the sermons of a street preacher from Eire extolling the soldiery of Ethiopia to lay down their lives for the holy cause. Perhaps they might even witness the Church Engineers procession taking their latest invention to be tested in the front lines.| As the nominal supreme commander of all the Faithful armed forces, the Duke of New Antioch is a title of unrivalled prestige and honour. But despite swearing fealty to the Duke, in reality most of the troops from across all of Christendom who come to do battle against Hell operate in units of their own, taking commands from their leaders and making their own strategic decisions.| Still, some soldiers do indeed renounce their citizenship and take up the cross, and come to serve under Duke Constantine alone. Thus the standing army of the Principality is the greatest single fighting force the Faithful can muster, and those who serve on the walls of the Home of Hopes are rightfully proud of their livery.| In recent years the Duke has despatched small forces into No Man's Land to gather intelligence, look for artefacts of power, conduct raids on Heretic forces, secure strategic strongpoints and loot the battlefields for the wealth of coin and weaponry scattered across the tortured landscape that stretches between New Antioch and the Heretic domains over the centuries. These warbands are simply given commission by the Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster their own forces. However, holy relics, great wealth and fame across all the Christendom ensures that there is a steady supply of ambitious leaders who are willing to risk all in the crucible of war. Competition for loot, supplies, artefacts and information is fierce, and these warbands often come to blows, not just with Heretical forces, but with competing rivals and crazed Trench Pilgrims."
5,The Cult of the Black Grail,"Epidemics of typhus, malaria, typhoid, smallpox, yellow-fever, pneumonia, trench fever, Markisian disease and countless others ravage the trenches and battlefields of the Great War, but they all pale in comparison to the most dreaded of them all: the Black Grail.| Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies, stands apart from the other lords of Hell, who act mainly through their mortal followers. Instead, when he periodically gains supremacy in the bitter power struggles of the archfiends, he sends forth his deadliest curse.| Infused with demonic essence from the bowels of the seventh layer of Hell, where the putrid fortress of Beelzebub stands, spews forth a torrent of demonic hell-flies, scorpions, locusts and other infernal insects. The Hellgate opens and a veritable tidal wave of foulness emerges, flowing across the land at startling speed, consuming everything and leaving indescribable horror in its wake. After nine days the insect swarm exhausts itself, devouring its own in its insatiable hunger.| The Black Grail is indiscriminate in its hatred of all living things: its infections can spread to virtually any living biological matter, which bursts forth with tumours, boils and weeping pustules. Puddles and ponds of melted flesh are left in its wake, endless mouths left screaming in their agony, for the Black Grail destroys the body but leaves the mind intact to suffer. The Scientist-Priests of the Church and the Alchemists of the Sultanate fervently look for a way to inoculate their people against this foulest of diseases, but thus far they are without success. The only answer is to burn the infected settlements with specially-constructed flamethrower tanks that use holy anointing oil as the fuel for their weapons.| But if this is not done, or the countermeasures are too late, what happens next is even worse: bodies of men, horses, dogs, insects and other animals of every kind that are infected by the Black Grail lurch to their feet, driven by a demonic will. Not living, not dead, they become vessels to spread the corruption of their master ever further, forming warbands that strive to find and infect life of any kind. They also gather things that mortals value and bring this loot as well as grisly trophies to the feet of the idols of Beelzebub they erect. Thus the Cult of the Black Grail mocks the devotions of the Faithful and their prayers.| At the head of such warbands stand the knights of the Order of the Fly: those most depraved men and women who willingly embrace the Black Grail and whose devotion Beelzebub finds sufficient. They are granted weapons, armour and equipment corrupted by the hand of the Archfiend in exchange for sacrifices brought to the altars of Beelzebub, which these warbands build wherever they go, objects of grisly horror constructed from the remains of their victims shaped into the form of monstrous flies."
