2,Stealth Generator,Ranged attacks against a Death Commando suffer -1 DICE to all the attack rolls.
2,Hide,"As a RISKY ACTION the Commando can hide if any piece of scenery the model is touching can block line of sight to any direction, even partially. If successful, enemies cannot charge or target the Commando with a ranged attack, though blast radius weapons can still hit them if aimed at a different target and the Commando is within the blast radius. If after hiding the Death Commando moves in any way, charges or shoots, this effect is cancelled and the enemies can target the Commando as standard."

7,Infernal Bomb,"Choose a point on the battlefield that is visible to the Witch and within 36” and make a Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll is unsuccessful, the bomb is off-target and will deviate 1” from your nominated target point for each degree of failure of the Ranged Attack ACTION in a direction determined by your opponent (for example, if you rolled 5, the bomb lands 2” away, as 7-5=2). The direction is decided by your opponent. Once the landing site of the bomb has been determined, it will detonate. Roll once on the Injury Chart for each model that is within 3” of where the bomb landed. No to hit roll is needed.
If the bomb lands exactly on top of any model, roll with 3D6 on the Injury Chart and add the dice together! Other models hit by the Bomb roll on the Injury Chart as standard. Any model hit but not taken Out of Action by this attack is blown D3” directly away from the point of impact, stopping if they hit other models/ buildings/objects. This attack has the Keyword SHRAPNEL and therefore causes an additional +1 BLOOD MARKER. Cover, range and higher position do not affect the attacks by the Infernal Bomb. Roll injuries for models in cover/behind intervening terrain with -1 DICE.
Once the landing site of the bomb has been determined, it will detonate. Roll once on the Injury Chart for each model that is within 3” of where the bomb landed. No to hit roll is needed."

The Shrine Anchorite will then shatter the bones of the volunteer and carry the broken victim to the battle on its Wheel. Any attacks against the Anchorite are then taken by the volunteer instead of the Anchorite (using the Armour of the volunteer) until the volunteer has been taken Out of Action. Down result against the volunteer does not affect the Anchorite movement. Note that they are otherwise treated as a single model and share any BLOOD MARKERs from any source. A volunteer cannot make any ACTIONs or move -for obvious reasons. At the end of the battle, even if the Volunteer would have survived, the model dies and is removed from your Warband."

You can attack each model with only one of the Melee Attacks available to the Assassin. After resolving both attacks, you can decide which of the two positions the Assassin ends up in after making the melee attacks."
