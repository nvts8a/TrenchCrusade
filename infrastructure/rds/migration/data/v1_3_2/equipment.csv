In chambers deep below the surface, generations of young assassins are raised in the dark; fed a diet of scorpions, frogs, deadly mushrooms and even stranger, more noxious things, and generation by generation their tolerance grows.

98,Sacrificial Lamb,equipment,,,"Before the battle, this lamb is sacrificed to God’s glory, and the pilgrim then anoints themselves with its blood, averting the wrath of Yahweh while fighting for His cause. The model ignores the first BLOOD MARKER or INFECTION MARKER it suffers in combat."
